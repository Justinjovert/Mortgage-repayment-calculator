## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- Built a main container with two sections; the section where the user input values, and the section where it displays the resulsts. I used GRID to display two columns for bigger screens. For lower screen sizes, I used media queries to set GRID to only 1 column. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- GRID
- Flexbox

### Continued development

- What I like to do in the future is a feature that changes the currency when interacted by the user.
